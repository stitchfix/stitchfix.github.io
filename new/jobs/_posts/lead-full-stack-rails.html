We are looking for an experienced full-stack engineer who has built or worked heavily on a couple of Rails applications and has some other MVC framework experience. You want to learn from an experienced development team and develop your own skills.

You may not have much hands-on product experience but it’s something you are keen to learn because you love talking to your clients &amp; users about what you can build for them. You are interested in how StitchFix works as a business, not just in the technology, and you would like a chance to make it work even better.
